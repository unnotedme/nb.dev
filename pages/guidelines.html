            <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
            <h3>What are Community Guidelines?</h3>
            <p>It is a set of rules to guide a group of people's conduct and activities per its principles and
                objectives.
                These rules were and will continue to be built or edited as needed and the community grows, so they can
                always be consulted. We expect the rules to be adhered to and taken seriously by the community, and we
                are
                also open to suggestions and constructive criticism of them where relevant. We emphasize that this code
                will
                be considered by the community in all its groups and social networks, as well as in any event or project
                organized by the community.</p>

            <h3>What is nb.dev?</h3>
            <p>In an extremely binary world, we want to live beyond 0 and 1.
                nb.dev is a group for non-binary people who are part of the technology area, being a student,
                professionals or even enthusiasts.</p>

            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <p>The goal of nb.dev is to increase non-binary representation in the tech world. We propose to bring
                literacies to companies, vacancies focused on the trans community and study and employability aid for
                employees. Our mission is to make technology less binary, more inclusive and accessible.</p>
