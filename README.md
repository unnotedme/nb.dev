***In an extremely binary world, we want to live beyond 0 and 1.***  
  
NB.DEV is a group for non-binary people who are part of the technology area, being a student, professionals or even enthusiasts.  
  
The goal of NB.DEV is to increase non-binary representation in the tech world. We propose to bring literacies to companies, vacancies focused on the trans community and study and employability aid for employees. Our mission is to make technology less binary, more inclusive and accessible.
